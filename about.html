				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h5>Introduction</h5>
				<p>I am Camille a 1st year Multimedia Artist in Saint Louis University.
					 I became interested in digital arts when I was 14 years old, what inspired me to do digital arts is when I saw an illustration of my favorite book that I was reading that time.
					 I’m only good at doing character illustration but this course helps me to come out in my comfort zone.
					  I’m starting to have an interest in logo design and background design..</p>
